I'm just a beginner , and this is my first script , so please give me some advices to develop myself in writing scripts . 
This is a script to automate some django commands , Like ("start a new project , new app , runserver , migrate , install django,make a super user ...") . 
I wish it will be useful 
Its useful for me to Be Honest because I hate to write same commands again and again (It's so Boring) . 
You Can do those commands just by typing the number of The Command , Its easy to use .
